# Spell-Checker
Bloom FIlter Based Spell Checker through Functional Programming

Hashing can be used to implement a spell checker.  Instead of comparing a word with entries in a dictionary of words, the wordâ€™s hash valueh(w) is used to index into a bitvector.  A bitvector is an array of booleans ,i.e., each entry is either true (= 1) or false (= 0).  If bitvector(h(w)) = false, the word is spelled incorrectly.  The bitvector is created by applying a hash function to each word in the directory, setting the the bitvector to true (:= 1) for the computed hash value, i.e., bitvector(h(w)) := 1 for all words in the dictionary. Typically, the memory requirement of a dictionary of words is much larger than  the  memory  requirement  of  its  corresponding  bitvector. In  addition, indexing into the bitvector (or any other array data structure) is typically much faster than using any lookup technique based on string comparisons.
